<h3>About this Template</h3>
<p>On August thirtieth of the year thirteen-thousand, a lone android remains in the hallway of the science center. It's a large building the androids built hundreds of years ago in which to assist the re-colonization of Earth. The main goal of the scientists within has been abandoned, for the most part -- it is spoken of in dreamy tones, but without any hope of success. Earth will, after all, never be the way it used to be; over time, the planet's atmosphere heals, but time cannot be reversed. Humans will never walk the Earth as they once had; the rotting, decayed buildings will never be used again; the animals who once lived will never be quite the same.</p>

<p>And yet 2B finds herself here, tapping her heel rhythmically against the floor as she watches through the display window in front of her. She herself lost the hope she once had long ago, but that does not mean it is lost forever. This is why she returns to the science center every few months; not for hope, but desperation.</p>

<p>The majority of the science building has been converted for research purposes. Through the research conducted, the androids have been able to set up various thriving settlements. They have been able to create farms and ranches to tame and support the surrounding wildlife -- and the dream of someday being able to sustain human existence. Rather than having a direct chain of command -- with secrets and lies and conveniently withheld information -- the androids work together as equals. They weren't created to live this way, but they are eking out their survival on the desolate planet as best they can.</p>

<p>The wing 2B is standing in resides at the very center of the building -- easy to overlook when traversing the maze of the halls, but always at the back of everyone's mind. She doesn't have to look around to know she's alone; the silence coating the halls is proof enough that she is alone in her vigil. The ending hour draws near, anyways -- the time when this particular experiment always fails. Very few specimens tend to survive the incubation period, but every so often there would be one to survive longer than usual. And yet, it's the last stretch that always ends in failure.</p>

<p>2B closes her eyes, waiting for the screech of machinery that the end inevitably brings. She reaches out to touch the glass that separates her from something quite different -- something quite special. The screech never comes, and she waits another minute. The countdown of seconds stretches on and on.</p>

<p>As the machinery beeps on, its quiet tone a comfort, 2B opens her eyes. The experiment has not failed; not this time.</p>

<p>It is what humans may have called a miracle.</p><br>
